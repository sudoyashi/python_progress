## Self Reminders on git commands

To push files from local to remote
```
git init
git status
git add filesyouwantaddedhere
git commit -m # "use -m as message flag and add your commit message in 2xQuotes here"
git remote add origin https://github.com/sudoyashi/python_progress
git remote -v # the flag "-v" indicates verbose, shows the remote url. Helpful to confirm this will be the correct url to push
git push
```
## Personal Log

December 29, 2020 - LOL it's been 2 years

-I'm returning back to learning python to get started working with data science. I want to relearn python so I can get into data science to help develop tree ordinance for the City and County of Honolulu. There's a lot of data available within the City's urban forestry division, but without proper cleaning and applied data science, it'd be useless! I want to do this as a part of my 1 year contract working with the City to refine their argument to acquire more funding and support for City tree planting and maintenance.

November 27, 2018 - Creating my repo on github; day 1
-I work with multiple computer workstations and have been having trouble working out making progress on the files I have been writing. Decided to create a github repo in order to keep the same files I am working on over multiple workstations.

This is my first README file for my first repo. Lots of mistakes and lots of bad practice will probably occur, so looking forward, I will
try to review what I have done in the past to create better projects for the future.
