November 27, 2019 - Creating my repo on github; day 1
-I work with multiple computer workstations and have been having trouble working out making progress on the files I have been writing. Decided to create a github repo in order to keep the same files I am working on over multiple workstations.

This is my first README file for my first repo. Lots of mistakes and lots of bad practice will probably occur, so looking forward, I will
try to review what I have done in the past to create better projects for the future.
